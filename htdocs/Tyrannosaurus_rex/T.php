    <h1>Tyrannosaurus rex</h1>
    <p>Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the most ferocious predators to ever walk the Earth. With a massive body,
        sharp teeth, and jaws so powerful they could crush a car, this famous carnivore dominated the forested
        river valleys in western North America during the late Cretaceous period, 68 million years ago. Although
        T. rex is a household name, what we know about this tyrannosaur is constantly evolving. Improved technologies,
        such as biomechanical modeling and x-ray imaging, have allowed scientists to gain a deeper understanding of
        how this apex predator lived.
